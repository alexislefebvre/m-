M- (pronounced "em dash") is a design system based 100% on web standards. This makes M- [extremely light](http://m-docs.org/#performance), very fast, and compatible with just about any type of web project!

M- can works with any framework - client-side or server-side - or no framework at all because it's made from native HTML, [custom HTML tags](https://dev.to/jfbrennan/custom-html-tags-4788), and [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/customElements). SSR, SPA, PWA, static site, email template - whatever type of project you have M- will work. This is especially useful to organizations looking to share a design system, but committing to one JavaScript framework or one architecture is not possible or desirable.

Try M- right now by just linking to the CDN files below and then visit the [doc site](http://m-docs.org) to learn more. If you want to use your own design language, just fork this project and customize the code (it's a really easy codebase to work in).

## Quick start
This is the web, so just add these links in `<head>` and you're done!
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/m-@1.2.3/dist/min.css">
<script defer src="https://unpkg.com/m-@1.2.3/dist/min.js"></script>
```
Or install via NPM and bundle and host with your assets: `npm install m-` (built files are located in `/dist`)

## Browser support
M- works with the latest versions of:

- Chrome
- Chrome for Android
- Safari
- iOS Safari
- Firefox
- Edge

Other modern browsers that support [Custom Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/customElements) are likely to work, but are not tested ([file a bug](https://github.com/jfbrennan/m-/issues) if you see something). IE is not supported and is unlikely to work even if you polyfill.

## Working with this project
_Pre-reqs:_ [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [Gulp CLI](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start)

1. Clone the repo (or fork)
1. `cd m-`
1. `npm install`
1. `gulp watch`
1. `cd docs`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`

That builds M-, watches for changes, and starts the doc site. Start coding!

### Coding notes
Custom Element constructors have strict rules about what you can safely do inside them. Please get familiar with [Requirements for custom element constructors and reactions](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-element-conformance).

Some components are custom HTML tags that require no JavaScript. Other components are Custom Elements and for these the styles are also maintained in a separate CSS file.

### How to publish the npm package
Just run `gulp release` when a new version is ready to be published. Be sure to set the appropriate semver type (patch, minor, major) in the `npm version` command in the gulpfile beforehand. Don't forget to then deploy the doc site.

### How to deploy the doc site
1. Zip the contents of `docs` excluding `node_modules`.
1. Go to AWS > us-east-2 > Elastic Beanstalk > Environments > MDocSite-env
1. Click 'Upload and deploy' button
1. Pick the .zip file from step one, accept the default version label, and click 'Deploy'
1. Monitor the deploy. The site goes down for a minute and should automatically come back up with the new version.
 
## Other stuff
Some IDEs complain about unknown HTML tags. If that's the case, add this list to make it happy:
`m-accordion, m-alert, m-autocomplete, m-badge, m-box, m-breadcrumb, m-col, m-container, m-dialog, m-dot, m-icon, m-loader, m-menu, m-row, m-tab, m-tabs, m-tag, m-vbar`
